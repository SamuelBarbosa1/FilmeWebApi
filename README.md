<h1 align="center"> Project Movie Web Api </h1>

## :memo: Description
* I created a film Web Api where you can add your films or created films, entering the name of the film, its film genre and number of minutes for hours between 70 and 400 minutes.
* All films inserted or registered are within a database

* To be able to run the project on your machine, first you download the project on your machine and in "appsettings.json" you change the location of the database " "FilmeConnection": "server=localhost;database=filme;user=root;password =root"
"and enter your account and password created in mysql

* ## :books: Functionalities

* You can create or add a movie.
* Remove registered films.
* Change the film registered as "name", "genre" and "duration".
* All films inserted or created will be stored in a database where they will not be requested<br>you can find them in schemas.
* Inside the Movie you will have "POST, GET, PUT, PATCH AND DELETE" where you will enter the name of the movie.
* And you will have the Schemas with the names "CreateFilmeDto", "Operation", "OperationType", "ReadFilmeDto" and "UpdateFilmeDto".
